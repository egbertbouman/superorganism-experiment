# superorganism-experiment
We are creating our own society. A place citizens have FULL control, have their own MONEY, have AI that serves THEM, and CONTROL together. Unstoppable by design, self-replicating, self-hosted, self-evolving, and human oversight with democratic governance. Well, that is our Utopian dream! It now runs and empowers a network of _seedboxes_.

Our work contains several novelties: 
- ⏩ Streaming Torrents. Quality streaming in P2P, competitive to Tiktok/Youtube/Netflix {warning: [still on seperate branch](https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/discussions/9003). Streaming GUI requires QT, decoder, Javascript bloat 🥹}.
- 🪞 Self-replication. Servers that can buy other servers using Bitcoin. Fully automated cloning of servers.
- ⚡ Trust. First trust framework and true Peer-to-Peer agent communication fabric. No DNS, no central control.
- 🧑‍🚒 AI models in a real-time competition for survival of the fittest using multi-arm-bandit and model score gossip.
- 👓 Find information using decentralized relevance ranking
- 🥇 First decentralized voting system. Your place, your control, your vote.
- 🥼 User-driven self-evolution. The emergent voting behavior is that users drive the roadmap using democracy. No lawyer or company can stop the will of the people.

## Towards recursive self-improving AI

Citizens should control AI. We want control of AI to be as simple as possible. Superorganism has a voting system based on new features. For example:

![demo_of_democratic_voting_process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5881768-71df-4a82-8f7b-ad3c02a64ceb)

Our superorganism is an _exploratory_ experiment for self-hosted and self-improving systems under direct human control. It is a decentralized system ability to create seedboxes, vote on systems changes, and donate GPU resources for decentralised AI. It runs on our machines, but it's complex stuff.

4) Search engine (ToDo [integrate our decentralized learn-to-rank AI algorithms](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.07452v1))
5) Voting and use your Bitcoin wallet to stake your identity (ToDo move from testnet to mainnet)

## General

Qt UI resources are listed in the [ui/resources/](ui/resources/) directory, including icons, fonts, images, and the resource manifest. They must be converted using the PySide6 resource compiler. Run the following command after adding new UI resources:

```bash
pyside6-rcc ui/resources/resources.qrc -o ui/resources/resources_rc.py
```

## Local Bitcoin regtest environment

This project uses a local **Bitcoin Core regtest node** for development and integration testing. Regtest is a private blockchain intended for testing. It does not connect to mainnet, and blocks can be mined on demand.

The script `scripts/regtest.sh` automates the local setup by:

- creating a dedicated regtest data directory inside the project
- generating a bitcoin.conf
- starting bitcoind
- creating or loading a wallet
- mining initial blocks so the wallet has spendable funds
- exposing simple commands for status, reset, mining, and demo transactions

### Dependencies

The script requires:

- bash
- bitcoind (part of **Bitcoin Core**)
- bitcoin-cli (part of **Bitcoin Core**)
- jq (for JSON parsing)

### Installing dependencies

#### macOS

```bash
brew install bitcoin
```

```bash
brew install jq
```

### Project-local data directory

The script stores all regtest data inside the repository:

```aiignore
.bitcoin/regtest-demo/
```

### Configuration

The script supports a few environment variables, but all have sensible defaults.

| Command            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`            | Starts the regtest node, creates the config file if needed, loads or creates the wallet, and ensures the wallet is funded. On first startup, the script mines 101 blocks. This is necessary because coinbase rewards must mature before they become spendable. |
| `stop`             | Stops the running regtest node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `reset`            | Deletes the local regtest blockchain and wallet state, then starts from a clean environment. This is useful for repeatable integration tests.                                                                                                                  |
| `status`           | Prints basic blockchain and wallet state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `mine`             | Mines one or more new regtest blocks. This is especially useful for confirming transactions during testing.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `send`             | Sends a demo transaction from the local wallet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `treasury-address` | Prints the address of the treasury. This is useful for funding the wallet from external tools or for testing incoming transactions.                                                                                                                            |
| `sign-psbt`        | Signs a base64 PSBT with the local demo wallet using `ALL\|ANYONECANPAY` and prints the signed PSBT. This is intended for the local funding-pledge flow.                                                                                                       |
